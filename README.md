### Vector Dot Product
**The dot product is a fundamental way we can combine two
vectors. Intuitively, it tells us something about how much two
vectors point in the same direction.**

***We write the dot product with a little dot between the two
vectors (pronounced "a dot b"):***
*a.b=|a||b| cosÎ¸*

~~This was a mistake~~
> This text is give the knowlege about multivariable function specially dot product.
Some important points:
```
a.b=0 implies angle is 90.
a.b=ab implies angle if 0.
```

- When angle between a and b is 0 then a.b=|a||b|.
* When angle between a and b is 90 then a.b=0.
+ When angle between a and b is 30 then a.b=|a||b|/2.

# Table
| CROSS PRODUCT | DOT PRODUCT|
| :--- | :--- |
| The cross product is the product of the magnitude of the vector and the sine of the angle in which they subtend other. |The dot product is the product of the magnitude of thevectors and the cos of the angle between them |
| The output is a vector. | The output is a scalar. |




**MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION**


**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n
a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
